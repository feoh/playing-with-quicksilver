I grew up in the 80s playing video games.

One day, I was sitting there playing some game on my [Mattel Intellivision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellivision),
and I had the same epiphany hundreds and thousands of others had around the same time.
I realized **I** wanted to be the one controlling the little world playing out behind the TV screen.
That's when my love affair with computing began.
