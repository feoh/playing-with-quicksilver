![Cookie The Rescue Chiweenie](../src/images/CookieLoungeTongue.png)

This is my blog. There are many like it, but this one is 
authentically mine.

I wrote the content, I (badly!) chose the colors,
styled the pages. All of it.

My skills in the area of web design are nascent at best
but I hope to grow them over time.

I also plan to use this site as a jumping off point for other
experiments in technology and thought.

But mostly, I want this to be a place to play :)

In that spirit, the picture attached to this post is
my adorable rescue dog Cookie, hanging out with Winnie
The Pooh, for no other reason than it makes me smile :)
