If you're anything like me, the last several years have been a rough go.

The overturning of Roe V. Wayde was a blow to women's rights here in America.
Please don't tell me about how it was bad law. From my perspective you're
arguing over academics when countless women are suffering and, in some cases
literally dying due to the narrow minded and in many cases bigoted laws being
passed in many red states.

And then, when governor DeSantis in Florida signed a bill into law that made
gender affirming care illegal, for me, that was the last straw.

I am a very firm believer in the idea that every society should be judged by the
way it treats its weakest members, and by that measure we are failing miserably.

Between war, disease and strife in our own country, it would be very easy to
just drown in a sea of negativity even when many of us lead lives of relative
splendor, especially compared to just about anywhere else in the world.

So to that end, I was tremendously inspired by a post from someone whose work I
very much admire on the Fediverse:

Not long after that post, I happened to be at a local Infosec conference where I
saw a talk about [Techs for Reproductive Justice](https://techies4rj.org/).

Those folks are seriously awesome people and doing really great work, so I've
been doing my best to help out there.

It feels *good* to actually *do* something. To move the needle as a result of
your actions, even if it's only by an infinitesimal amount.

So I would humbly suggest that others do the same. Take that energy you might
otherwise spend reading the news or doom scrolling and put it towards helping
out with some charity or cause group.

"Be the change you want to see in the world" may be a cliche, but it's also the
truth :)
