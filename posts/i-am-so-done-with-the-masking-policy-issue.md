First off:

- I am not against masks.
- I am not against mask policies.
- I am not against people expressing their views in an attempt to influence
civic policy.

But I am sick and tired of watching communities tear themselves apart and event
organizers be put in the unenviable position of angering one half of the
populace or another.

<!-- TEASER_END -->

I understand that you feel that being forced to wear a mask is an affront to
your personal freedoms, and I also understand how the other half of you feel
that this is a public health crisis and that there is only one right answer to
this situation.

And I am sick as all get out of listening to/reading posts by all of you :)

I've had COVID-19 three times thus far myself. As someone who's 55 years old,
I take this issue VERY seriously and will often mask in large groups where I
can.

Now can we all please stop being at each others throats about this and get back
to trying to live our lives the best we can in a crazy 2024? :)
