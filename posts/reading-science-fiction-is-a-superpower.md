I sometimes wonder if the degree to which escaping into the recesses of my own
imagination was something that came out of being partially blind.

Perhaps more than most I have always found the inspiration I draw from the
stories I read to be an incredible tool in my toolbox.

While I read expansively in just about every genre (OK I can't stand romance,
although I've enjoyed more than a few outstanding love stories in my time!)
there is something very particular about the way science fiction and fantasy
transport me to another time, place, or universe altogether that I find to be
particularly powerful.

Sure, we can find inspiration in people who live differently than we do, perhaps
because their culture is different from ours or the situations they're facing
are unusual, but how does that compare with walking a mile in the shoes of an
alien that has no feet? And might live on a world where even the basic axes of
our existence like food, water and air are totally meaningless?

Right now, I'm reading _Dune_ by Frank Herbert. In that society there are
several factions (NOPE! TODO: FIX) including the Bene Gesserit.

Litany:

> "I must not fear.
> Fear is the mind-killer.
> Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
> I will face my fear.
> I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
> And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
> Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
