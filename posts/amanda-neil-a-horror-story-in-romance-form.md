The recent news around Amanda Palmer and Neil Gaiman is provoking some deep
thoughts around the nature of the relationship between art, most notably popular
art, and artists.

## Enter Sandman
I fell in love with Neil Gaiman work in college in the late 80s. I had an
amazing visual arts instructor who told us to go to a GOOD comics shop and take
the time to find something we truly enjoyed and could become immersed in - swept
away by. 

The comic shop owner and I had a conversation, and he pointed me at Sandman
issue 1. I was blown away. Myth and magic woven through tales that spoke to a
deep sense of wonder and ... reverence? I have always had for civilizations past
and the tales they told.

And dark. These stories were DARK in ways I hadn't encountered before. They
spoke of cruelty and murder and torture and unjust imprisonment. Of the
hardships of life and death and what it might be like to be a being that in some
ways transcended all these things, and in others not so much.

I'll admit it never really dawned on me that one of the threads tying the
_Sandman_ narrative together was the idea that we should pity for monster. That
they can hurt too. All of this was in a disconnected realm of fantasy. An escape
from the bits of my life that fit like a bad suit.

And then, 3+ decades later to learn that in fact these stories that spoke to me
so deeply, that meant so much to me were written by a man who *is* a monster in a
very real sense? Well, needless to say I'm finding that hard to take.

## The (Dresden) Doll's House And What Happened There
And then there's Amanda Palmer. I fell in love with her work through her band,
the Dresden Dolls.  I first saw them at Arisia, a Boston area science fiction
convention, sometime in the 90s.

I was blown away. Most music at cons could most kindly be called
"earnest but amateurish".

The Dolls were different. They were musically TIGHT and the drummer, Brian
Vigilone was and is FANTASTIC. The lyrics were darkly beautiful, and
Amanda Palmer has incredible stage presence. The lyrics were also
DARK, but hey, this is art, right? It encompasses the full breadth of the human
experience.

## Wuv, Twoo Wuv
When I read that two of my favorite artists had become "an item" and were seen
after yoga eating the delicious fresh rolls at a favorite local cafe of mine, I
couldn't help but get that warm fuzzy feeling humans get when two people they
like get together, even when, as in this case, they don't actually know either
person *AT ALL*.

And for a few years, it was good.

## Trouble in ... Paradise?
And then the pandemic hit and the world turned upside down.

Even before that, I'd heard rumors that there was trouble in Neil & Amanda-land.

Then, I read about a podcast where rape / abuse allegations were involved.

And I am embarrassed to say I paid relatively little attention to it.
