# EFF Kiwi Farms Blog Post

Seeing a lot of people (rightly?) be up in arms about the @eff@mastodon.social's
stance on Kiwifarms.

I will say that the situation has more subtlety and complexity than it seems on
the surface, so while I won't condemn anyone for coming down on these folks for
their arguably questionable stance, you should at least read their
[position statement](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/08/isps-should-not-police-online-speech-no-matter-how-awful-it) on the topic.

My take? I think their argument contradicts itself.

They claim that ISPs should not become a choke point for censoring the internet
because tier 1 ISPs represent a monopoly.

The monopoly aspect is true, but in the world we live in *today* ISPs are the ONLY
mechanism we have for ensuring that content a vast swath of society finds morally
repugnant can be removed.

What we really need (and what I maintain their argument is actually tilting towards)
is for large ISPs to be regulated like utilities, and for their to be clear
guidelines under the law for content that's beyond the pale and needs to GO AWAY.

It's a thorny one to be sure. I still love and support the EFF, but in this case
I think they picked the wrong horse.
