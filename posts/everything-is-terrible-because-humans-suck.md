As I write this, I am enjoying the final moments of a rare privilege in modern
society: A few weeks off between jobs.

We all know how it feels to come to the end of a vacation and think "Wow that
FLEW by. What did I DO?". I made a conscious decision to use this time well, and
I'm happy to say that I think I have.

This did consist of some things some people might feel smelled too much like
work (I wrote a lot of skill building code using exercises from
[Pybites](https://codechalleng.es)). That aside though, most of what I did aside
from the occasional bit of goofing off was read and think.
